The AI engineer's trajectory shows an iterative and often challenging development process for Lust auf Landwirtschaft. Initially, the focus was on deploying a non-functional MVP, facing significant hurdles with Netlify before successfully migrating to Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend). A major recurring theme was synchronizing backend data (especially crop names and machine attributes) with frontend expectations, leading to extensive debugging of  and . The AI engineer frequently introduced new issues while fixing existing ones, leading to user frustration over wasted credits and broken functionality. Key features added include dynamic crop yields, market prices, detailed fertilization and plant protection logic, a weather widget, and visual enhancements like soil quality and seasonal progress. The conversation highlights the complexities of full-stack consistency, environment variables, and careful deployment. The work concludes with the AI engineer acknowledging persistent issues, specifically with harvest machine filtering and a critical decision to Fork Session to resolve it.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal for Lust auf Landwirtschaft is to create a fully functional online virtual farming platform where users can lease plots and manage agricultural activities. Initially, the app was non-functional due to a missing backend dependency. Key requirements evolved to include robust deployment (Vercel/Render), enabling live plot purchases via PayPal, and extensive feature enhancements for realism and user experience. These encompass:
-   **Crop Management**: Addition of Winterraps and specific Winter prefixes for crops (e.g., Winterroggen, Winterweizen) with accurate yields and market prices. A new Khorasan-Weizen crop with specific yield and high market value.
-   **Machinery & Operations**: Implement Rauch AXIS M fertilizer spreader, and specific rules for displaying mechanical vs. mineral fertilizers based on biologisch (organic) farming. Detailed, crop-specific plant protection logic for various crops (e.g., Wintergerste, Winterraps), including seasonal treatments (autumn/spring).
-   **User Interface & Data**: Integrate a weather widget for Grabow (39291), change Erntegut text to An Landwirt zu aktuellen Marktpreisen verkaufen, ensure accurate display of 5 plots and 15 machines without duplicates. Incorporate a specific Lust auf Landwirtschaft logo. Adjust shipping costs (25€).
-   **Core Functionality**: Ensure plots are selectable, farming workflow functions, and PayPal buttons render for payment processing. Active plots count should reflect confirmed orders.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React**: Frontend development for dynamic user interfaces.
-   **FastAPI**: Python framework for building the backend API.
-   **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data persistence (plots, machines, orders).
-   **Vercel/Render**: Cloud platforms for frontend and backend deployment.
-   **PayPal API**: Payment gateway integration.
-   **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration for URLs and API keys.
-   **Full-stack Synchronization**: Maintaining consistency between frontend display and backend data.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack setup with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.

**Key Files and Changes:**

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Defines the core API logic, data models, and database interactions. It houses all business logic related to crops, machines, plots, and financial calculations.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Updated  Enum to include Winter prefixes (e.g., , ) and added .
        -   Modified , , and  to reflect new/updated crop data and prices.
        -   Refined  and  to ensure accurate machine definitions, including , , , and  attributes for proper filtering. This involved significant debugging to eliminate duplicate machine entries and ensure correct initial database setup.
        -   Added  import to resolve plot creation errors.
        -   Implemented  API endpoint to track active plots.
        -   Corrected  Pydantic model to include , , , and  fields.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: The main React component that manages the application's state, UI rendering, API calls, and user interactions.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Extensive debugging and modification of  logic to ensure the app fetches real data from the backend consistently.
        -   Updated machine filtering logic for fertilization () and plant protection (, , ) to match backend data.
        -   Implemented  for correct display of Winter crops and Khorasan-Weizen.
        -   Integrated the  and added new visual components for soil quality and a seasonal progress bar.
        -   Added logic to display active plot count from the backend.
        -   Modified how machine costs ( vs. ) are displayed to align with backend.
        -   Adjusted  hooks to prevent duplicate data fetching and ensure  is called appropriately.
        -   Implemented conditional rendering for organic/mineral fertilizers based on .
        -   Temporarily added/removed debug console logs for troubleshooting.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Displays weather information and agricultural recommendations.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial creation. (No further significant changes mentioned in trajectory beyond initial creation details from system prompt).

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Application branding.
    -   **Changes Made**: Replaced with a new, modern SVG logo provided by the user.

-   , , , , :
    -   **Importance**: Configuration for Git and deployment platforms.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified during initial deployment attempts (Netlify/Vercel/Render) and later adjusted to ensure correct build processes and asset accessibility. These were critical for getting the application online.

<pending_tasks>
-   The immediate task is to repair the harvest machine filtering logic in the frontend to correctly display only suitable machines (e.g., Mähdrescher for cereals, Mais-Häcksler for Silomais, and both for Winterroggen when applicable).
-   Verify full functionality of the live application on  once the current fixes are deployed.
-   Consider implementing seasonal logic for planting and harvesting (e.g., Aktuell nicht möglich outside of season).
-   Integrate real weather forecasting for recommendations.
-   Implement detailed cost transparency with breakdowns and Bio vs. Konventionell comparisons.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on addressing critical issues identified on the preview URL, which mirrored issues expected to hit the live site. The user reported that the application was displaying:
1.  **Incorrect Harvest Machine Filtering**: For crops like Winterroggen, all four harvest machine options were still shown, rather than the expected two (Mähdrescher and Häcksler for Ganzpflanzensilage). Similarly, other crops might not have been correctly filtered. The backend was updated to support this (Chat Message 764-766), but the frontend filtering was still problematic.
2.  **Live-Tracking Prematurely Displayed**: The user requested the removal of the Live-Tracking feature, as it was deemed too early. (Chat Message 773-774).
3.  **Incorrect Seasonal Progress Bar**: The seasonal progress bar was not adapting to new plot purchases, expected to start at 0%. This was addressed by setting  based on the plot's creation or expected start time (Chat Message 775-776).

The AI engineer's last actions involved removing the Live-Tracking component and adjusting the seasonal progress. The most pressing unresolved issue, which led to the Fork Session request (Chat Message 780), is the persistent incorrect filtering of harvest machines in the frontend. The AI engineer explicitly stated that the Ernte-Problem ist noch nicht gelöst and confirmed that Winterroggen zeigt immer noch alle 4 Ernte-Maschinen.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to repair the harvest machine filtering logic in the frontend so that crop-specific harvest machines are correctly displayed.
