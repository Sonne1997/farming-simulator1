The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack farming simulator MVP from scratch, transitioning from initial concept to a feature-rich application. The development followed an iterative approach, incorporating user feedback at each stage. Key achievements include setting up the React, FastAPI, and MongoDB stack, implementing core features like parcel leasing, crop selection, and machine usage. The engineer meticulously integrated dynamic pricing, soil type effects, and detailed agricultural processes like fertilization and pest control based on user-provided real-world data (yields, costs, market prices). Frontend localization to German and comprehensive UI enhancements, including dynamic image selection and logo integration, were also completed. The AI engineer demonstrated strong problem-solving, particularly in refining data models and ensuring data consistency across frontend and backend. The trajectory shows a clear focus on delivering a functional and realistic product, addressing user-reported issues like logo display and data duplicates promptly.

<product_requirements>
The application is a farming simulator where users can virtually lease 250m² land parcels (18m x 13.8m) located at 39291 Grabow. Users can choose soil cultivation methods, select from a restricted list of crops (rye, wheat, barley, triticale, silage maize, sugar beet, alfalfa, grass, flower mix, peas), and opt for conventional or organic farming.
The system incorporates:
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Parcels cost 7.5€ to 10€, influenced by soil points (25-45).
- **Machinery Selection**: Structured into Tillage, Sowing, Plant Protection, Fertilization, Care, and Harvest. Specific real-world machines (e.g., John Deere tractors, Horsch Pronto, disc harrow, hoe, harrow, Cambridge roller, stone collecting) are available with associated costs.
- **Fertilization**: Offers mineral (SSA, KAS) and organic (pig/cattle slurry, digestate, cattle manure) options. Nitrogen demand calculation (120 kg N/ha average) is based on crop and expected yield, with specific fertilizer costs.
- **Plant Protection**: Conventional includes 3 phases (autumn/spring herbicide, spring fungicide) at 35€/ha. Organic farming uses hoe and harrow.
- **Yield & Market Value Calculation**: Based on specific per-hectare yields for each crop (e.g., wheat 5 T/ha, sugar beet 60 T/ha) and market prices (e.g., wheat 170€/T). Flower mix provides a 700€/ha subsidy. Rye can be harvested as whole plant silage with specific yield/price.
- **Harvested Goods**: Can be acquired and shipped, with an option for the farmer (user) to buy back at world market prices.
- **UI & Localization**: Fully in German with a custom logo and realistic agricultural field images.

        - Integrated logic for calculating expected crop yields, market values, and costs based on real-world inputs (e.g., per-hectare data, 250m² parcel conversion).
        - Developed  system to dynamically adjust plot prices (7.5€-10€ for 25-45 soil points).
        - Populated and refined  with comprehensive machine types grouped by agricultural activity (Bodenbearbeitung, Aussaat, Pflanzenschutz, Düngung, Pflege, Ernte), including costs and specific models (e.g., John Deere 8R370, Horsch Pronto 6 DC, Scheibenegge, Hacke, Striegel, Cambridge Walze, Güllefass 18m, John Deere T660i Mähdrescher).
        - Implemented detailed  for mineral (SSA, KAS) and organic (Schweinegülle, Rindergülle, Gärreste, Rindermist) options, including N content and costs.
        - Defined  for various crops to support fertilization calculations.
        - Structured plant protection measures with specific autumn/spring herbicide and spring fungicide applications, calculating costs (35€/ha).
        - Ensured uniqueness of machine entries in the database to prevent duplicates.

<current_work>
The AI engineer's most recent work focused on a comprehensive refinement of the application's agricultural simulation logic, ensuring high realism and adherence to user-provided specifics. This involved:
1.  **Enhanced Plant Protection Details**: Implementing specific conventional plant protection steps, including one herbicide treatment in autumn, one in spring, and one fungicide treatment in spring. The associated cost of 35€ per hectare was accurately calculated and applied to the 250m² parcel size.
2.  **Granular Fertilization Management**: The fertilization section was deeply re-structured in both backend and frontend. It now differentiates between mineralische Düngung (mineral fertilization) and organische Düngung (organic fertilization). Mineral options include SSA (Schwefelsaures Ammoniak) at 350€/tonne and KAS (Kalkammonsalpeter) at 300€/tonne, with nitrogen content (21kg N/100kg SSA, 27kg N/100kg KAS) used for calculating the required amount to meet an average of 120kg N/hectare. Organic options include Schweinegülle (pig slurry), Rindergülle (cattle slurry), Gärreste (digestates), and Rindermist (cattle manure), with an average application of 40m³/hectare (translated to 1m³/parcel).
3.  **Expanded Machine Fleet**: New, specific machine models were added to enhance realism:
    *    for sowing.
    *    and  for fertilization.
    *    for plant protection.
    *   The generic Mähdrescher was renamed to .
These updates primarily involved modifying  to update the  and related calculation logic, and  to reflect these detailed options and costs in the user interface. The application is now in a highly detailed and realistic state, awaiting the user's decision on its future.
