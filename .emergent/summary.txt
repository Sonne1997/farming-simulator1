The AI engineer's work trajectory chronicles a challenging journey from a non-functional MVP to a fully deployed, feature-rich application. Initially, the core problem was getting the app online, which involved debugging a missing  dependency and persistent Netlify deployment failures. This phase highlighted the complexities of containerized environments,  file management, and external CI/CD platforms. Despite numerous guaranteed fixes, Netlify proved problematic due to issues like Yarn Workspaces,  exclusions, and caching. The frustration led to a pivot to Vercel for frontend and Render for backend.

Once deployed on Vercel/Render, the focus shifted to enhancing realism and functionality. This included adding new crops, machinery, detailed fertilization and plant protection logic with dynamic pricing, and a weather widget. A significant challenge arose when backend data inconsistencies (old crop names) caused display issues on the live frontend, leading to a crucial backend update phase. The trajectory ends mid-update of the backend, with the AI engineer recognizing the need to update numerous references to old crop types, indicating the iterative nature of development and the intricacies of a full-stack application. The persistent debugging of deployment issues and the meticulous addition of agricultural realism define this work.

The user's primary goal was to make a virtual farming platform, Lust auf Landwirtschaft, fully functional and accessible online for users to lease plots and experience real agriculture. Initially, the application was not accessible, and the core problem was identified as a backend issue due to a missing Python dependency.

Upon successful local deployment, the requirements evolved:
1.  **Deployment**: Get the app online via . This involved extensive debugging of Netlify deployment issues, leading to a switch to Vercel for frontend and Render for backend.
2.  **Live Functionality**: Transition from a demo version to a real version where customers can purchase plots using PayPal. This necessitated setting up MongoDB Atlas, configuring PayPal Live credentials, and integrating the live backend.
3.  **Feature Enhancements**:
    *   Add Winterraps crop with specific yield (2.5 t/ha).
    *   Include Rauch AXIS M fertilizer spreader.
    *   Implement logic: if biologisch (organic) farming, only show mechanical fertilizers; otherwise, show mineral fertilizers.
    *   Detailed Pflanzenschutz (plant protection) based on seasons (autumn/spring) and crop types (e.g., specific treatments for Wintergerste, Winterraps, Zuckerrüben, Silomais, Sommer-Erbsen), including costs.
    *   Integrate a weather widget for Grabow, 39291 with automatic recommendations.
    *   Change Erntegut option to An Landwirt zu aktuellen Marktpreisen verkaufen.
    *   Ensure all 5 plots and 15 machine lists are displayed correctly without duplicates.
    *   Integrate the Lust auf Landwirtschaft logo.
    *   Adjust shipping costs to align with real-world scenarios (GLS 40kg package, 25€).
    *   Update crop names to Winterroggen, Winterweizen, Wintergerste, Wintertriticale.

**Directory Structure:**



**Key Files and Changes:**

-   :
    -   **Importance**: This is the core of the FastAPI backend, defining API endpoints, data models, and business logic, including PayPal integration.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initially, fixes involved ensuring  dependency was installed and the server started correctly.
        -   Updated  Enum to include Winter prefix for relevant crops (e.g., , , , , ).
        -   Updated  dictionary to reflect new crop types and their yields.
        -   Updated  dictionary for new crop types.
        -   In the last interaction, the AI engineer was in the process of updating 98 further references to these old crop types within the backend code to ensure consistency.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: The main React component handling application state, UI rendering, API calls, and user interactions. This file contains most of the frontend logic.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Fixed an issue where  was not called, leading to empty crop selection. A  hook was added/fixed to trigger data fetching on  change.
        -   Implemented a Demo Mode with mock data for static deployment on Netlify/Vercel.
        -   Added static mock data for 5 plots and 15 machines.
        -   Added  component import and rendering logic within the header.
        -   Implemented conditional rendering for fertilization machines based on mineralisch or organisch selection.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the backend update to accurately reflect all Winter crop names and their related logic throughout the  and other backend files.
-   Verify the live application on Vercel and Render for full functionality after the final backend update.
-   Consider implementing the proposed design improvements (e.g., modern color palette, animations, interactive map, progress bar, tooltips).
-   Address shipping cost implementation within the app, possibly by limiting quantity or offering local pickup.

<current_work>
The immediate work being carried out is a critical backend update to synchronize crop names between the frontend and backend. The user observed that despite frontend code changes (e.g., Winterroggen instead of Roggen), the live application still displayed old crop names. This was diagnosed as the backend  holding outdated crop type enumerations and related data.

Specifically, the AI engineer has:
1.  Updated the  Enum in  (Chat Message 676) to include the Winter prefixes (e.g., , , , , ).
2.  Modified the  dictionary in  (Chat Message 678) to align with the new  names and their corresponding yield values.
3.  Updated the  dictionary in  (Chat Message 682) similarly.

The AI engineer identified that there are 98 further references to the old crop types within the backend code (Chat Message 684) that need to be updated to prevent crashes and ensure data consistency. The current state is that the backend is half-repariert (half-repaired), and a Fork Session was requested to allow the AI to complete these remaining updates without pushing a potentially broken backend to GitHub.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to complete the updates to all remaining references to the old crop types in the backend code.
