# Production environment variables for Netlify deployment
# Note: For production, you need to configure a backend server
# This is a frontend-only deployment, so backend features won't work
# without configuring a separate backend deployment

# If you have a backend server deployed (e.g., on Railway, Heroku, etc.)
# replace this URL with your backend URL
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-url.com

# PayPal Client ID for production (replace with your production keys)
